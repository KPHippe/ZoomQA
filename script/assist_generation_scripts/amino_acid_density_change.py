    This method is responsible for finding the distance category a distance falls into

    Returns:
    --------

        This integer represents the radius category that the distance falls into (e.g. a radius of 6.7 would return 7 meaning
        that the target amino acid is within a radius of 7 angstroms). It will return None if the distance is greater

    dist_dict:
        This dictionary has keys of each amino acid as well as 'total' and the values represent the occurrences of each amino acid. Total
        represents the total number of amino acids represented in this dictinoary.
